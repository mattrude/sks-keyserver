# With SKS, two hosts can efficiently compare their databases then
# repair whatever differences are found.  In order to set up
# reconciliation, you first need to find other SKS servers that will
# agree to gossip with you. The hostname and port of the server that
# has agreed to do so should be added to this file.
#
# Empty lines and whitespace-only lines are ignored, as are lines
# whose first non-whitespace character is a `#'.

# Example:
# keyserver.linux.it 11370
